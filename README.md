## Evolution

### Ploting

Plot functions (both stdlib, and runtime) would be useful and appreciated.
Plotting is powered by gnuplot, it will works on Unix-like (MacOS, Linux) but I don't have any idea about Windows

- [X] Plot stdlib functions
- [X] Plot runtime functions
- [X] Save plot to png/svg/pdf

- [X] Add terminal ploting
    - [X] Calculate ploting height and width
    - [X] Computes individual points
    - [X] Generate each line
    - [X] Prints each line

- [X] Auto level x axis in termplot
- [X] Auto level y axis in termplot

#### Example of plotting

You can plot function defined in the standard library of calc or user defined functions, to display the help just type `plot()`

![](docs/assets/plot_help.png)

You can then plot for example

Plotting cos with the default values (from 0 to 3pi, with a step of 0.01pi)

![](docs/assets/plot_cos_default.png)

Plotting sin with custom values (from -pi to pi, with a step of 0.01rad, with line, title, x label, y label)

![](docs/assets/plot_sin_custom.png)

Defining f(x) = x² and plotting it with custom values (from -10 to 10, with a step of 0.1, with linespoint)

![](docs/assets/plot_f.png)

#### Example of terminal plotting

You can plot in the terminal, for example 

![](docs/assets/plot_term_x_squared.png)

And it supports the labels too

![](docs/assets/plot_term_x_squared_labels.png)

And now it auto scales on y!

![](docs/assets/termplot_cos.png)

### Exact math calculator

As this project provides a frontend with a parser we could plug an exact math engine in the backend to transform `calc` into a 
real exact math calculator.
TODO List for the Exact Math Engine

- [ ] Rational calculation
  - [ ] Implement rational numbers operations 
  - [ ] Rational reduction
- [ ] Irrational calculation 
  - [ ] Implement irrational numbers operations
  - [ ] Irrational reduction
- [ ] Literal calculation
  - [ ] Computes literal expression with uninitialized operators
  - [ ] Literal reduction

### CAS

If we ever go to this step, yes, I will remove the "minimalistic" from the description
- [ ] It's hard.

## Examples

### REPL with only Lexing (verbose mode: on by default)

![](docs/assets/test_lexing.png)

### REPL with lexing and basic operation parsing (verbose mode: on by default)

![](docs/assets/test_parsing_basic_operations.png)

### REPL and functionning interpreter (verbose mode: off by default)

![](docs/assets/test_interpreter.png)

## Configuration

You can configure the general color, greeting message, greeting color, prompt and prompt color from the file for example
in (for linux)

```
~/.config/mini-calc/mini-calc.toml
```

Or situated in your operating system config folder.


You can interact with the configuration with the command line, more info in [the web page](https://calc.nwa2coco.fr/config.html)


### What the configuration looks like

The default configuration looks like this

![img.png](docs/assets/img.png)

### Colors

Available colors are

- purple
- cyan
- blue
- black
- red
- yellow
- green
- white
- an hexadecimal colour (ex: "#f7a8d8")

Default colour (if the configuration fail to load) is Cyan.

### Example of a modified configuration

Configuration:

![img.png](docs/assets/config_modified.png)

It looks like:

![img.png](docs/assets/config_looks.png)

## Functions

The following functions are available

- sin
- cos
- tan
- sinh
- cosh
- tanh
- asin
- acos
- atan
- exp
- ln (alias: log)
- sqrt
- factorial (alias: fact)
- abs
- ceil
- floor
- round

### Trigonometry

For trigonometry, the input are assumed to be in radian, if not, you have to put "false" or "true" as second argument,
example shown bellow

![img.png](docs/assets/trigo.png)

### Exp/ln

If you use the exp function you can pass a second argument for the base you are using, if no second arguments are passed
this is assumed to be in natural base

![img.png](docs/assets/expln.png)

### Root

You can take the nth root with the sqrt function, by default it takes the second root.

![img.png](docs/assets/nth_root.png)

### Round

You can round to the nth decimal with the round function, by default it round to the integer (floor)

![img.png](docs/assets/round.png)

## Logic

You can now use logic! I implemented the following functions:

- or (alias : ||)
- and (alias : &&)
- geq (alias : `>=`)
- gt (alias : `>`)
- leq (alias : `<=`)
- lt (alias :`<`)
- eq (alias : `==`)

Example:

![img.png](docs/assets/logic.png)

## User defined functions!

You can define your own functions!

![img.png](docs/assets/user_defined.png)

## Vector calculation !

You can use vectors! 

- add vector to each others
- added the `norm` function to compute the norm
- dot product between two vectors ( * operator)

Functions added: 
- norm

![](docs/assets/vector.png)

## Matrices !

As of 2.7.0 matrix algebra is implemented (using lup reduction)

- you can add matrices 
- multiply compatible matrices

functions added
- transpose
- invert
- det 

![](docs/assets/matrix.png)
