## Trigonometry

For trigonometry, the input are assumed to be in radian, if not, you have to put "false" or "true" as second argument, example shown bellow

## Exp/ln

If you use the exp function you can pass a second argument for the base you are using, if no second arguments are passed this is assumed to be in natural base
