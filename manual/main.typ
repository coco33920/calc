= Introduction
#v(1em)
#calc is a fully-featured calculator written in Rust for education purpose, it 
was designed to be minimalistic but then went off the rails and a lot of feature
where implemented.

Now #calc is a powerful calculator capable of exact rational computation,
matrix and vectors algebra, bindings to gnuplot and terminal plotting, with
dozens of updates and currently (as of writing this manual) in version *2.11.4*.

If you prefer a website you may want to read
#link("https://calc.nwa2coco.fr/book",[*The Online Book*]) which is always up to
date.

== Install

You can install it via cargo 

```sh
cargo install mini-calc
```

or via the source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/coco33920/calc
cd calc 
cargo build --release
./target/release/mini-calc
```

= Usage

== Basic operators

#calc have the basic operators which are

- `+` for the addition
- `-` for the substraction
- `*` for the multiplication
- `/` for the division (or for a rational)
- `^` for the exponentation

== Variables

It also supports variable the syntax is 

```
myvar = value
```

for example

```
var = (2+2)
```

)
#set align(left)

== Built-in variables

The following variables are built-in:

- `pi` is pi as a double precision float
- `e` is e as a double precision float

#pagebreak(weak: true)

= Functions

== Implemented

The following functions are currently implemented:

*Trigonometry* 

- `sin` (vectorized)
- `cos` (vectorized)
- `tan` (vectorized)

*Hyperbolic trigonometry*
- `sinh` (vectorized)
- `cosh` (vectorized)
- `tanh` (vectorized)

*Reverse trigonometry*
- `acos` (vectorized)
- `asin` (vectorized)
- `atan` (vectorized)

*Exponentiation*
- `exp` (vectorized)
- `ln` (alias: log) (vectorized)

*Vectors*
- `norm`

*Matrices*
- `det`
- `invert`

*Plot*
- `plot`
- `termplot`

*Other*
- `sqrt` (vectorized)
- `factorial` (alias: fact)
- `abs`
- `ceil`
- `floor`
- `round`

== Trigonometry 

For trigonometry, the input is assumed to be in radians, if it is in degrees you
need to add `false` or `true` as a second argument, example shown bellow.

#set align(center)
#figure(
  image("assets/trigo.png"),
  caption: [Usage of trigonometry]
)
#set align(left)

#pagebreak(weak: true)
== Exp/ln 

If you use the exp function you can pass as a second argument the base you want
to use if no second arguments are passed it will used the natural base.

#set align(center)
#figure(
  image("assets/expln.png"),
  caption: [Usage of exp/ln]
)
#set align(left)

#pagebreak(weak: true)
== Root 

You can specify in second argument an integer to take the nth root, if not it
take the square root.

#set align(center)
#figure(
  image("assets/nth_root.png"),
  caption: [Usage of sqrt]
)
#set align(left)

== Partial function

The calculator's language supports partial function.

#set align(center)
#figure(
  image("assets/function.png"),
  caption: [Example of a partial function]
)
#set align(left)

#pagebreak(weak: true)
== Vectorization
Functions have been vectorized.

#set align(center)
#figure(
  image("assets/sqrt_vectorized.png"),
  caption: [Example of a vectorized function]
)
#set align(left)

== User defined function
You can defined your own function

#figure(
  image("assets/user_defined.png"),
  caption: [Definition of function]
)
#pagebreak(weak: true)

= Configuration

You can configure the general color, greeting message, greeting color, prompt
and prompt color in a toml file found for example on linux in 

```sh 
~/.config/mini-calc/mini-calc.toml
```

#set align(center)
#figure(
  image("assets/img.png"),
  caption: [Example of the default configuration]
)
#set align(left)

== Colors
Available colors are

- blue
- black
- purple
- green
- cyan
- red
- yellow
- white
- an hexadecimal color (ex: \#f7d8a8)

The default color (or if your colour can't be parsed) is cyan

#pagebreak(weak:true)

== Example of a modified configuration

#set align(center)
#figure(
  image("assets/config_modified.png"),
  caption: [Example of a modified config]
)
#set align(left)

it looks like 

#set align(center)
#figure(
  image("assets/config_looks.png"),
  caption: [Modified configuration in action]
)
#set align(left)

== Interact in the command line 

You can interact in the command line with the config, the commands are 

- config: show the config help
- config reload: reload the config from the file
- config reset: reset the config 
- config show: show the current config
- config set `<category>` `<value>`

categories are:

- greeting_message
- greeting_color
- prompt_color
- prompt
- general_color

)

#pagebreak(weak:true)
= Logic

== Implemented operators

The following operators have been implemented:

- or (alias: `||`)
- and (alias: `&&`)
- geq (alias: `>=`)
- leq (alias: `<=`)
- gt (alias : `>`)
- lt (alias: `<`)

== Example

#figure(
  image("assets/logic.png"),
  caption: [Example of logic]
)

#pagebreak(weak: true)

= Plot
You can plot, the backend is provided by GNUPlot, so it should work great on
linux and macos, the behaviour on windows is unknown.

== Help
To display the help just type `plot()`

#figure(
  image("assets/plot_help.png"),
  caption: [Help of plot]
)

== Plot

=== Default 
It's easy to plot a function just type `plot(fn)`

#figure(
  image("assets/plot_cos_default.png"),
  caption: [Plot of the cos function with default values]
)

#pagebreak(weak: true)
=== Options

A more difficult operation is with values, `plot(sin,-pi,pi,0.01,"sin","x(rad)","y","line")`.

#figure(
  image("assets/plot_sin_custom.png"),
  caption: [Plot with overloading of default values]
)

=== Plot your own function

You can plot your own defined functions!

#figure(
  image("assets/plot_f.png"),
  caption: [Plot of an user-defined function]
)

#pagebreak(weak:true)
== Terminal plotting
You can plot _right_ into your terminal

=== Default

The best example to show it is the square function between -5 and 5 with a 0.1 step. The x axis is automatically scaled but not the y axis for now.

#figure(
  image("assets/plot_term_x_squared.png"),
  caption: [Terminal plotting of an user defined function]
)

#pagebreak(weak: true)
=== Options
The terminal supports labels as options

#figure(
  image("assets/plot_term_x_squared_labels.png"),
  caption: [Terminal plotting with options]
)
#pagebreak(weak: true)
=== Auto y scaling 
It scales automatically in y too!

#figure(
  image("assets/termplot_cos.png"),
  caption: [Example of a plot with y auto-scaling]
)
#pagebreak(weak: true)

= Vectors computation

You can compute vectors using these functions,

- add vectors 
- dot product (\* operator)
- norm function

#figure(
  image("assets/vector.png"),
  caption: [Example of vector computation]
)

= Matrices computation

As of 2.7.0 matrix algebra was added to the calculator you can

- add matrices
- multiply compatible matrices

functions added

- transpose
- invert

#figure(
  image("assets/matrix.png"),
  caption: [Example of matrix computation]
)

And as of 2.11.5 they are pretty printed with each column being aligned.

  image("assets/aligned_matrices.png"),
  caption: [Pretty printed matrix]
)

#pagebreak(weak:true)
= Exact math 

== Rational exact math 

As of 2.11.0 rational exact math was added, supports for 

- rational operations
- rational reduction
- rationalization of floats (precision: 10 digits)

=== Examples

#figure(
  image("assets/exact_rationals.png"),
  caption: [Example of rational computations]
)
